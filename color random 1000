//after my 2 balls were set, I realized that my structure isnt set to make 
//more than one ball spececifically, making 1000 would actually requirw me to write
//1000 ellipse code. I will imprement code made that makes the number of balls a variable, 
//meaning defining balls as a variable. the setup between my two sets of code are almost
//identical, all that is different is calling a class. calling the ball and adding its
//start sets location 
//ok not exactly the same, xspeed and direction for example are called out in voids. 

//first i looked to change the color of tha balls, which was defined in the statements
//above, I then set it to random. 
//after this I set the color tones, I went to allply it in the draw, this made the colors
//not only random, but appear to sparkle when it is rewritten.
